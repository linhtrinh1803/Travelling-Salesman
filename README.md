# Travelling Salesman Problem

## Overview
This project is dedicated to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various algorithms and approaches. The TSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that asks, "Given a list of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city?"

## This repository contains code and resources related to solving TSP instances using different algorithms.

Algorithms and Approaches
We have implemented and explored multiple algorithms for solving the TSP, including but not limited to:

Brute Force
Nearest Neighbor
Genetic Algorithms
Simulated Annealing
Dynamic Programming
Christofides Algorithm
Concorde TSP Solver

## Dataset
To demonstrate the TSP algorithms, we use various datasets with cities and their distances. You can find these datasets in the data directory.
